        "They are dealt the same number of cards. They both flip the card on the top of their deck. Whoever has a card with higher value wins the round and gets one point (if the cards are of the same value, neither of them gets a point). After this, the two cards are discarded and they flip another card from the top of their deck. They do this until they have no cards left.\n",
